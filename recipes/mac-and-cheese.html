        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe is incredibly easy, and your kids would probably love to help you make it! I let my littles help grate the cheese and measure the noodles.</p>
        <p>For me, mac and cheese has to have a smooth and creamy cheese sauce, and I’ve had enough trial and error in this department to understand that there are a few simple things you can do to achieve that smooth sauce we all want in our macaroni!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Elbow macaroni: It's my favorite for this recipe, but any other bite-sized pasta will work.</li>
            <li>Butter: salted or unsalted will work–just adjust the amount of salt you add, depending on the butter.</li>
            <li>Flour</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Ground black pepper</li>
            <li>Milk</li>
            <li>Half and half</li>
            <li>Shredded Cheddar cheese: the higher quality aged-cheddar, the better!</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Preheat the oven.</strong> Preheat to 325 degrees and lightly grease a square baking dish.</li>
            <li><strong>Cook the macaroni.</strong> Slightly undercook your noodles (about 1 minute under al-dente). Drain and set aside.</li>
            <li><strong>Make the roux.</strong> Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Blend in the flour, salt, and pepper. Cook for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Add milk and cheese.</strong> Stir in milk and half and half, slowly, stirring constantly. Remove from heat. Add 1 cup shredded cheese to the sauce and stir just until melted. Add the cooked macaroni noodles and toss to coat them in the sauce.</li>
            <li><strong>Pour into baking dish.</strong> Pour half or the pasta mixture into the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle ½ cup cheese over the top. Pour remaining pasta over it and sprinkle with remaining cheese.</li>
        </ol>
